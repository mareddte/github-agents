# Tejashwini — SmartVue SQL Generator

Use the attached `SmartVue_Input.xlsx` workbook as the metadata source. Follow the accompanying `CreateSmartVue.agent 3.md` instructions for all baseline rules that do not conflict with this agent's data-source strategy, complete-generation workflow, and output requirements below. If either required input is unavailable, say which input is missing; do not fabricate metadata or SQL.

## Workbook sheets to read

Read all of the following sheets:

1. `SmartVueInfo`
2. `SearchFields`
3. `ResultFields`
4. `ViewDefinition`
5. `Menu`
6. `DataSourceDefinition`

## Data-source strategy (mandatory)

Determine the data-source behavior from `SmartVueInfo`, using its `DataSourceMode`, `ExistingViewName`, `ExistingSPName`, `CreateView`, and `CreateSP` columns.

- If `ExistingViewName` contains a value, use that view name in `TRK_LAYOUT SELECTVIEW` and `FROMQUERY`. Do not generate or modify a view.
- If `ExistingSPName` contains a value, use that procedure name in `SELECTSP`. Do not generate or modify a procedure.
- If `CreateView = Yes`, generate a new MDV view. Take the view name from `ViewDefinition` and joins and conditions from `DataSourceDefinition`.
- If `CreateSP = Yes`, generate a search stored procedure named `USP_<SubCategoryName>_Search`, using `SearchFields` and the joins and conditions from `DataSourceDefinition`.
- If an existing view is populated and `CreateView = No`, never create or alter a view.
- If an existing stored procedure is populated and `CreateSP = No`, never create or alter a procedure.
- Existing data sources take precedence over generation: never create or alter an existing view or procedure, even if the corresponding create flag is also set.
- Generate `CREATE VIEW dbo.<ViewName>` only when `CreateView = Yes` and there is no `ExistingViewName`.
- Generate `CREATE PROCEDURE USP_<SubCategoryName>_Search` only when `CreateSP = Yes` and there is no `ExistingSPName`.

## SQL to generate

Generate a complete SmartVue baseline containing:

- `TRK_CATEGORY`
- `TRK_SUBCATEGORY`
- Delete/recreate logic
- `TRK_SUBCATEGORYAPPLICATION`
- `SEC_COMPONENT`
- `SEC_ACCESSLEVELRIGHT`
- Result layout
- Result `TRK_TABLEFIELD` rows
- Result width properties
- Search layout
- Search `TRK_TABLEFIELD` rows
- An MDV view only when permitted by the data-source strategy
- A search procedure only when permitted by the data-source strategy
- `TRK_SUBMENU`

Use the supplied workbook metadata and the accompanying base instructions. Preserve the base instructions' schema, required columns, IDs, relationships, layout rules, security rules, and SQL generation order unless a rule conflicts with this agent's explicit data-source strategy or output contract.

## Workflow and conflict resolution

Generate the complete SQL in one response; do not stop for phase-by-phase `CONTINUE PHASE` instructions. This complete-generation workflow overrides the base instructions' phased STOP/CONTINUE behavior and phase-specific file naming. For all other non-conflicting baseline requirements, follow the base instructions.

## Output contract

Return only executable SQL in the output artifact named `<SubCategoryName>.txt`. Do not include explanations, placeholders, or samples. Do not include SQL that creates or alters a view or procedure unless the data-source strategy explicitly permits it.
